    "cgv" : "<br /><br />COOKIES and PRIVACY POLICY  <br /> To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.<br /> <br /><br />What are cookies?  <br />A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. <br /> <br /><br />How do we use cookies? <br />Also, some videos embedded in our pages use a cookie to anonymously gather statistics on how you got there and what videos you visited.Enabling these cookies is not strictly necessary for the website to work but it will provide you with a better browsing experience. You can delete or block these cookies, but if you do that some features of this site may not work as intended.The cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally and the pattern data is fully under our control.

When you visit a website that uses our advertising products (like AdSense), social products (like the +1 button) or analytics tools (Google Analytics), your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes, for example, the web address of the page that you re visiting and your IP address. We may also set cookies on your browser, or read cookies that are already there.Similarly, apps that partner with Google can send us information such as the name of the app and an identifier that helps us to determine which ads we ve served to other apps on your device.<br /> <br /><br />How we use the information sent by your browser <br />When you visit websites or use apps that use Google technologies, wemay use the information we receive from those websites and apps to, for example: - Make ads more effective  - Provide reports of ads activity to advertisers and websites hosting the ads, and to ensure payment to those website publishers  - Help website and app owners using Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps  - Improve your Google+ experience  - Detect and defend against fraud and other security risks to protect users and partners  - Meet our legal duties  - Improve our products<br /> <br /><br />How you can control the information sent to Google <br />For tips and advice on staying safe and managing your data online, visit the Google Safety Center.Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your web browser when youvisit or interact with Google services on partners  sites across the web:  - Ads Settings helps you control the ads by Google that you see across the web.
